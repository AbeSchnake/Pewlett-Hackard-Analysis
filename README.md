# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
This analysis was performed in order to gather information about and prepare for an upcoming "Silver Tsunami" for the company Pewlett Hackard, in which there will be a sizeable wave of retirees in a short period of time.

## Results
* A table showing every title that any retiring employee has ever held was generated, part of which is shown below.

## Summary
In order to replace the full workforce that will be lost in the Silver Tsunami, 25,916 Senior Engineers, 24,926 Senior Staff, 9,285 Engineers, 7,636 Staff, 3,603 Technique Leaders, 1,090 Assistant Engineers, and 2 Managers will need to be hired over the next 3 years, making the total number of new employees needed 72,458. This is a significant number, and additional recruitment efforts should begin immediately in order to have these employees onboarded and trained.

There are 1,549 outgoing employees eligible for the mentorship program. If every eligible mentor decided to adopt the role, there would be 1 mentor for every 46.78 new employees on average. Assuming that only some of the eligible mentors take the opportunity, then the ratio of new employees to mentors will be higher. This is enough mentors to provide valuable high-level support and be available to answer some questions, but Pewlett Hackard will not be able to provide new employees with large amounts of 1-on-1 mentorship for an extended period of time. The onboarding process should be smoothed out by the presence of the mentorship program, but many of the same difficulties as ever will be faced.

For additional insight into the Silver Tsunami, it may be beneficial to look at a table of different assumptions about the percentage of eligible mentors that will become part of the program and what the resulting new employee to mentor ratio would be.

As well, this analysis looked at employees who will retire over the next three years. This is valuable for the purposes of a high-level analysis of the Silver Tsunami, but a query looking at the retirees broken out by individual years, or even individual months, would be necessary for more detailed planning of the onboarding process.
